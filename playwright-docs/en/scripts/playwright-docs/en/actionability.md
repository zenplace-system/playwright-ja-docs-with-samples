Auto-waiting
============

Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")
------------------------------------------------------------

Playwright performs a range of actionability checks on the elements before making actions to ensure these actions behave as expected. It auto-waits for all the relevant checks to pass and only then performs the requested action. If the required checks do not pass within the given `timeout`, action fails with the `TimeoutError`.

For example, for [locator.click()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click), Playwright will ensure that:

*   locator resolves to exactly one element
*   element is [Visible](#visible "Visible")
*   element is [Stable](#stable "Stable"), as in not animating or completed animation
*   element [Receives Events](#receives-events "Receives Events"), as in not obscured by other elements
*   element is [Enabled](#enabled "Enabled")

Here is the complete list of actionability checks performed for each action:

Forcing actions[​](#forcing-actions "Direct link to Forcing actions")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Some actions like [locator.click()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click) support `force` option that disables non-essential actionability checks, for example passing truthy `force` to [locator.click()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click) method will not check that the target element actually receives click events.

Assertions[​](#assertions "Direct link to Assertions")
------------------------------------------------------

Playwright includes auto-retrying assertions that remove flakiness by waiting until the condition is met, similarly to auto-waiting before actions.

Visible[​](#visible "Direct link to Visible")
---------------------------------------------

Element is considered visible when it has non-empty bounding box and does not have `visibility:hidden` computed style.

Note that according to this definition:

*   Elements of zero size **are not** considered visible.
*   Elements with `display:none` **are not** considered visible.
*   Elements with `opacity:0` **are** considered visible.

Stable[​](#stable "Direct link to Stable")
------------------------------------------

Element is considered stable when it has maintained the same bounding box for at least two consecutive animation frames.

Enabled[​](#enabled "Direct link to Enabled")
---------------------------------------------

Element is considered enabled when it is **not disabled**.

Element is **disabled** when:

*   it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` with a `[disabled]` attribute;
*   it is a `<button>`, `<select>`, `<input>`, `<textarea>`, `<option>` or `<optgroup>` that is a part of a `<fieldset>` with a `[disabled]` attribute;
*   it is a descendant of an element with `[aria-disabled=true]` attribute.

Editable[​](#editable "Direct link to Editable")
------------------------------------------------

Element is considered editable when it is [enabled](#enabled "Enabled") and is **not readonly**.

Element is **readonly** when:

*   it is a `<select>`, `<input>` or `<textarea>` with a `[readonly]` attribute;
*   it has an `[aria-readonly=true]` attribute and an aria role that [supports it](https://w3c.github.io/aria/#aria-readonly).

Receives Events[​](#receives-events "Direct link to Receives Events")
---------------------------------------------------------------------

Element is considered receiving pointer events when it is the hit target of the pointer event at the action point. For example, when clicking at the point `(10;10)`, Playwright checks whether some other element (usually an overlay) will instead capture the click at `(10;10)`.

For example, consider a scenario where Playwright will click `Sign Up` button regardless of when the [locator.click()](/docs/api/class-locator#locator-click) call was made:

*   page is checking that user name is unique and `Sign Up` button is disabled;
*   after checking with the server, the disabled `Sign Up` button is replaced with another one that is now enabled.
