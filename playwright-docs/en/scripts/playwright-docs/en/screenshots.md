Screenshots
===========

Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")
------------------------------------------------------------

Here is a quick way to capture a screenshot and save it into a file:

    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });

[Screenshots API](/docs/api/class-page#page-screenshot) accepts many parameters for image format, clip area, quality, etc. Make sure to check them out.

Full page screenshots[​](#full-page-screenshots "Direct link to Full page screenshots")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Full page screenshot is a screenshot of a full scrollable page, as if you had a very tall screen and the page could fit it entirely.

    await page.screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png', fullPage: true });

Capture into buffer[​](#capture-into-buffer "Direct link to Capture into buffer")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Rather than writing into a file, you can get a buffer with the image and post-process it or pass it to a third party pixel diff facility.

    const buffer = await page.screenshot();console.log(buffer.toString('base64'));

Element screenshot[​](#element-screenshot "Direct link to Element screenshot")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Sometimes it is useful to take a screenshot of a single element.

    await page.locator('.header').screenshot({ path: 'screenshot.png' });
