Introduction[​](#introduction "Direct link to Introduction")
------------------------------------------------------------

Playwright Library provides unified APIs for launching and interacting with browsers, while Playwright Test provides all this plus a fully managed end-to-end Test Runner and experience.

Under most circumstances, for end-to-end testing, you'll want to use `@playwright/test` (Playwright Test), and not `playwright` (Playwright Library) directly. To get started with Playwright Test, follow the [Getting Started Guide](/docs/intro).

Differences when using library[​](#differences-when-using-library "Direct link to Differences when using library")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### Library Example[​](#library-example "Direct link to Library Example")

The following is an example of using the Playwright Library directly to launch Chromium, go to a page, and check its title:

*   TypeScript
*   JavaScript

    import { chromium, devices } from 'playwright';import assert from 'node:assert';(async () => {  // Setup  const browser = await chromium.launch();  const context = await browser.newContext(devices['iPhone 11']);  const page = await context.newPage();  // The actual interesting bit  await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());  await page.goto('https://example.com/');  assert(await page.title() === 'Example Domain'); // 👎 not a Web First assertion  // Teardown  await context.close();  await browser.close();})();

    const assert = require('node:assert');const { chromium, devices } = require('playwright');(async () => {  // Setup  const browser = await chromium.launch();  const context = await browser.newContext(devices['iPhone 11']);  const page = await context.newPage();  // The actual interesting bit  await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());  await page.goto('https://example.com/');  assert(await page.title() === 'Example Domain'); // 👎 not a Web First assertion  // Teardown  await context.close();  await browser.close();})();

Run it with `node my-script.js`.

### Test Example[​](#test-example "Direct link to Test Example")

A test to achieve similar behavior, would look like:

*   TypeScript
*   JavaScript

    import { expect, test, devices } from '@playwright/test';test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);test('should be titled', async ({ page, context }) => {  await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());  await page.goto('https://example.com/');  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example');});

    const { expect, test, devices } = require('@playwright/test');test.use(devices['iPhone 11']);test('should be titled', async ({ page, context }) => {  await context.route('**.jpg', route => route.abort());  await page.goto('https://example.com/');  await expect(page).toHaveTitle('Example');});

Run it with `npx playwright test`.

### Key Differences[​](#key-differences "Direct link to Key Differences")

The key differences to note are as follows:

Library

Test

Installation

`npm install playwright`

`npm init playwright@latest` - note `install` vs. `init`

Install browsers

Install `@playwright/browser-chromium`, `@playwright/browser-firefox` and/or `@playwright/browser-webkit`

`npx playwright install` or `npx playwright install chromium` for a single one

`import` from

`playwright`

`@playwright/test`

Initialization

Explicitly need to:

1.  Pick a browser to use, e.g. `chromium`
2.  Launch browser with [browserType.launch()](/docs/api/class-browsertype#browser-type-launch)
3.  Create a context with [browser.newContext()](/docs/api/class-browser#browser-new-context), _and_ pass any context options explicitly, e.g. `devices['iPhone 11']`
4.  Create a page with [browserContext.newPage()](/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-new-page)

An isolated `page` and `context` are provided to each test out-of the box, along with other [built-in fixtures](/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures). No explicit creation. If referenced by the test in its arguments, the Test Runner will create them for the test. (i.e. lazy-initialization)

Assertions

No built-in Web-First Assertions

[Web-First assertions](/docs/test-assertions) like:

*   [expect(page).toHaveTitle()](/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-title)
*   [expect(page).toHaveScreenshot()](/docs/api/class-pageassertions#page-assertions-to-have-screenshot-1)

which auto-wait and retry for the condition to be met.

Timeouts

Defaults to 30s for most operations.

Most operations don't time out, but every test has a timeout that makes it fail (30s by default).

Cleanup

Explicitly need to:

1.  Close context with [browserContext.close()](/docs/api/class-browsercontext#browser-context-close)
2.  Close browser with [browser.close()](/docs/api/class-browser#browser-close)

No explicit close of [built-in fixtures](/docs/test-fixtures#built-in-fixtures); the Test Runner will take care of it.

Running

When using the Library, you run the code as a node script, possibly with some compilation first.

When using the Test Runner, you use the `npx playwright test` command. Along with your [config](/docs/test-configuration), the Test Runner handles any compilation and choosing what to run and how to run it.

In addition to the above, Playwright Test, as a full-featured Test Runner, includes:

*   [Configuration Matrix and Projects](/docs/test-configuration): In the above example, in the Playwright Library version, if we wanted to run with a different device or browser, we'd have to modify the script and plumb the information through. With Playwright Test, we can just specify the [matrix of configurations](/docs/test-configuration) in one place, and it will create run the one test under each of these configurations.
*   [Parallelization](/docs/test-parallel)
*   [Web-First Assertions](/docs/test-assertions)
*   [Reporting](/docs/test-reporters)
*   [Retries](/docs/test-retries)
*   [Easily Enabled Tracing](/docs/trace-viewer-intro)
*   and more…

Usage[​](#usage "Direct link to Usage")
---------------------------------------

Use npm or Yarn to install Playwright library in your Node.js project. See [system requirements](/docs/intro#system-requirements).

    npm i -D playwright

You will also need to install browsers - either manually or by adding a package that will do it for you automatically.

    # Download the Chromium, Firefox and WebKit browsernpx playwright install chromium firefox webkit# Alternatively, add packages that will download a browser upon npm installnpm i -D @playwright/browser-chromium @playwright/browser-firefox @playwright/browser-webkit

See [managing browsers](/docs/browsers#managing-browser-binaries) for more options.

Once installed, you can import Playwright in a Node.js script, and launch any of the 3 browsers (`chromium`, `firefox` and `webkit`).

    const { chromium } = require('playwright');(async () => {  const browser = await chromium.launch();  // Create pages, interact with UI elements, assert values  await browser.close();})();

Playwright APIs are asynchronous and return Promise objects. Our code examples use [the async/await pattern](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Asynchronous/Async_await) to ease readability. The code is wrapped in an unnamed async arrow function which is invoking itself.

    (async () => { // Start of async arrow function  // Function code  // ...})(); // End of the function and () to invoke itself

First script[​](#first-script "Direct link to First script")
------------------------------------------------------------

In our first script, we will navigate to `https://playwright.dev/` and take a screenshot in WebKit.

    const { webkit } = require('playwright');(async () => {  const browser = await webkit.launch();  const page = await browser.newPage();  await page.goto('https://playwright.dev/');  await page.screenshot({ path: `example.png` });  await browser.close();})();

By default, Playwright runs the browsers in headless mode. To see the browser UI, pass the `headless: false` flag while launching the browser. You can also use `slowMo` to slow down execution. Learn more in the debugging tools [section](/docs/debug).

    firefox.launch({ headless: false, slowMo: 50 });

Record scripts[​](#record-scripts "Direct link to Record scripts")
------------------------------------------------------------------

[Command line tools](/docs/test-cli) can be used to record user interactions and generate JavaScript code.

    npx playwright codegen wikipedia.org

Browser downloads[​](#browser-downloads "Direct link to Browser downloads")
---------------------------------------------------------------------------

To download Playwright browsers run:

    # Explicitly download browsersnpx playwright install

Alternatively, you can add `@playwright/browser-chromium`, `@playwright/browser-firefox` and `@playwright/browser-webkit` packages to automatically download the respective browser during the package installation.

    # Use a helper package that downloads a browser on npm installnpm install @playwright/browser-chromium

**Download behind a firewall or a proxy**

Pass `HTTPS_PROXY` environment variable to download through a proxy.

*   Bash
*   PowerShell
*   Batch

    # ManualHTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npx playwright install# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packagesHTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1 npm install

    # Manual$Env:HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1npx playwright install# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages$Env:HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1npm install

    # Manualset HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1npx playwright install# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packagesset HTTPS_PROXY=https://192.0.2.1npm install

**Download from artifact repository**

By default, Playwright downloads browsers from Microsoft's CDN. Pass `PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST` environment variable to download from an internal artifacts repository instead.

*   Bash
*   PowerShell
*   Batch

    # ManualPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npx playwright install# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packagesPLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1 npm install

    # Manual$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1npx playwright install# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1npm install

    # Manualset PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1npx playwright install# Through @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packagesset PLAYWRIGHT_DOWNLOAD_HOST=192.0.2.1npm install

**Skip browser download**

In certain cases, it is desired to avoid browser downloads altogether because browser binaries are managed separately. This can be done by setting `PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD` variable before installing packages.

*   Bash
*   PowerShell
*   Batch

    # When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packagesPLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1 npm install

    # When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packages$Env:PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1npm install

    # When using @playwright/browser-chromium, @playwright/browser-firefox# and @playwright/browser-webkit helper packagesset PLAYWRIGHT_SKIP_BROWSER_DOWNLOAD=1npm install

TypeScript support[​](#typescript-support "Direct link to TypeScript support")
------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Playwright includes built-in support for TypeScript. Type definitions will be imported automatically. It is recommended to use type-checking to improve the IDE experience.

### In JavaScript[​](#in-javascript "Direct link to In JavaScript")

Add the following to the top of your JavaScript file to get type-checking in VS Code or WebStorm.

    // @ts-check// ...

Alternatively, you can use JSDoc to set types for variables.

    /** @type {import('playwright').Page} */let page;

### In TypeScript[​](#in-typescript "Direct link to In TypeScript")

TypeScript support will work out-of-the-box. Types can also be imported explicitly.

    let page: import('playwright').Page;
